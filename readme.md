## The Algorithm

This model used a dataset from a GitHub project by LoicMarie (Project Name: Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer). The simplified process of this model is that it takes a zip file that contains the dataset, unzips it into Colab, then trains the model. You then export it into the Nano and test it out!

## Running this project

1. Follow all the steps in the Google Colab - all steps for getting all the files, training the model, and exporting are all in there. (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ld_ep21-Ex49o_1cWYhzghTiafUBDQXk?usp=sharing)
2. All required libraries in order to train the model are in the requirements.txt 
3. Make sure your nano is set up and ready to go before you export it!
